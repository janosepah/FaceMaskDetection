# FaceMaskDetection

## Objective is to build a Deep Learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not.

The novel COVID-19 virus has forced us all to rethink how we live our everyday lives while keeping ourselves and others safe. Face masks have emerged as a simple and effective strategy for reducing the virusâ€™s threat and also, application of face mask detection system are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a face mask detector using deep learning.

## In this project, we try to implement multiple Deep Learning models including : 


*   ConvNet
*   VGG19
*   DenseNet201
*   OpenCV
*   MobileNet
*   ResNet50- 6 Models
*   YOLO5
# Conclusion
As the technology are blooming with emerging trends the availability so we have novel face mask detector which can possibly contribute to public healthcare. The architecture consists of MobileNet as the backbone it can be used for high and low computation scenarios. In order to extract more robust features, we utilize transfer learning to adoptweights from a similar task face detection, which is trained on a very large dataset.
We used OpenCV, tensor flow, keras , Pytorch and CNN to detect whether people were wearing face masks or not. The models were tested with images. The accuracy of the model is achieved and, the optimization ofthe model is a continuous process and we are building a highly accurate solution by tuning the hyper parameters.

# Use Cases
Here are a few use cases where this mask detection technology could be leveraged.

* Airports: 
The Face Mask Detection System could be used at airports to detect travelers without masks. Face data of travelers can be captured in the system at the entrance. If a traveler is found to be without a face mask, their picture is sent to the airport authorities so that they could take quick action.
* Hospitals: 
Using Face Mask Detector System, Hospitals can monitor if quarantined people required to wear a mask are doing so or not. The same holds good for monitoring staff on duty too.
* Offices & Working Spaces: 
The Face Mask Detection System can be used at office premises to ascertain if employees are maintaining safety standards at work. It monitors employees without masks and sends them a reminder to wear a mask.
* Government: 
To limit the spread of coronavirus, the police could deploy the face mask detector on its fleet of surveillance cameras to enforce the compulsory wearing of face masks in public places.
