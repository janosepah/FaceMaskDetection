# FaceMaskDetection

## Objective is to build a Deep Learning model which can identify if the person is wearing a mask or not.

The novel COVID-19 virus has forced us all to rethink how we live our everyday lives while keeping ourselves and others safe. Face masks have emerged as a simple and effective strategy for reducing the virusâ€™s threat and also, application of face mask detection system are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a face mask detector using deep learning.
